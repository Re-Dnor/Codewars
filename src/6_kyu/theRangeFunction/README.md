Let's implement the range function:

range([start], stop, [step])

start, if omitted, defaults to 0; step defaults to 1.

Returns a list of integers from start to stop, incremented (or decremented) by step, exclusive.

Note that ranges that stop before they start are considered to be zero-length instead of negative.
